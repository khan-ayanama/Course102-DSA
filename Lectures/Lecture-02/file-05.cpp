    // Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.

    int difference = 10 - 4;  // difference is now 6

    // Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.

    int product = 3 * 7;  // product is now 21

    // Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand.

    float quotient = 10.0 / 3.0;  // quotient is approximately 3.33333

    // Modulus (%): Returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand.

    int remainder = 10 % 3;  // remainder is 1
